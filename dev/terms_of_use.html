          encouraged. Everyone is invited and encouraged to voice their opinion regardless of whether they are in agreement with our staff, our contributors, or other 
          community members. However, the comment must be made in a way that is respectful and constructively contributes to the conversation. Examples of behavior that 
          will not be tolerated in our community include: direct or indirect name-calling, attacks, offensive language, or insults; unsupported accusations; derailing or 
          hijacking; trolling; or baiting others into an emotional response. These types of comments will be promptly removed, and the commenter will be warned or,

          language that is directly or indirectly violent or hostile is not welcome in our online community. A commenter who threatens the physical or emotional

          reported to law enforcement agencies and we will cooperate with them to any extent requested. If you see any threats or harassment in our community, please
